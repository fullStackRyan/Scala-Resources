One of the best Scala Developers I have ever met said he learnt Scala by reading the docs, so that's always a great place to start. But if you're like me, you'll need a little more help. I have compiled a list of books and video tutorials which have helped me along my Scala journey; I hope it helps you too :)

## Books

* Functional Programming, Simplified - Alvin Alexander
<p> This book is fantastic and answers many questions I had as a junior such as "How can there be no side-effects?"</p>

*   Essential Scala - Noel Welsh and Dave Gurnell (Underscore)

<p> Underscore have a number of great free books and courses. This book is responsible for helping me understand implicits </p>

*   Essential Effects - Adam Rosien
<p> I've bought the book but haven't got round to reading it yet but from what I understand this book helps shed light on the Cats Effect Library</p>

*    Functional Programming in Scala - Paul Chiusano and Runar Bjarnason
<p>A widely reccomended book within the scala community, although I'd start with "Functional Programming, Simplified" first</p>

* Scala With Cats - Noel Welsh and Dave Gurnell (Underscore)
<p>Cats Library; name deriving from category theory. One of the few books on the cats library and the only book to my knowledge that is free!</p>


## Udemy Courses

<p>I start with Scala Applied because these course provide a great overview of the scala language in short 2-3 min videos</p>

* [Scala Applied, Part 1](https://www.udemy.com/course/stairway-to-scala-applied-part-1/)
* [Scala Applied, Part 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/stairway-to-scala-applied-part-2/)
* [Scala Applied, Part 3](https://www.udemy.com/course/stairway-to-scala-applied-part-3/)

<p>Daniel Ciocîrlan has made many video both on Udemy, his website and YouTube. I would start with Scala Applied for a general overview then move onto Daniel Ciocîrlan's course for more an indepth functional and practical approach.</p>

* [Scala & Functional Programming for Beginners | Rock the JVM - Daniel Ciocîrlan](https://www.udemy.com/course/rock-the-jvm-scala-for-beginners/)
